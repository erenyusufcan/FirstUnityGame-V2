# 🎮 First Unity Game – Complete Project (Built From Scratch)

This project represents the first complete Unity game I built entirely from scratch within approximately one month.  
During the development process, I learned the full workflow of creating a game: from player movement to managers, from animations to prefabs, and from scene hierarchy to project structure.

It became my first “full pipeline” Unity experience.

## 🧩 What I Learned
Through this project, I gained real experience in:

- Designing a scalable game hierarchy  
- Working with prefabs and reusable components  
- Managing scripts through single-responsibility managers  
- Implementing player/enemy interactions  
- Handling collisions and trigger events  
- Creating a game loop and directing systems via GameDirector  
- Integrating animations with Animator & Avatar workflows

- Using Asset Store packages effectively  

This project significantly improved my understanding of Unity’s architecture.
